# SIMPLE REST API MOVIES

This is a simply REST API i've been created due my homework on week 9 independen study at Rakamin Academy.
The entire application is builded using `node.js`, `express`, `postgresql`, and `Multer` as a Image Uploaders, and this application is currently running only on local server.
to use this application, you need to install the package first using the following command below on the terminal:

## Install Package

    npm install

## Import Database

    Import the database

## Environment Variables

    Create your own .env file

## Run the app

    npm run start

    localhost:3000/

    You can easily test the app using my postman_collection, by importing the file into your postman app.
